        <p>The Japanese macaque - nicknamed Kingussie Kong - escaped from his enclosure on Sunday. 
            It is thought he may have got caught on Thursday after being tempted by some Yorkshire 
            pudding that had been left out overnight for the birds. A cheeky monkey that spent five 
            days on the run in the Scottish Highlands is "doing really well" after being captured and 
            returned to a wildlife park. It is thought that the Japanese macaque, named Honshu, may have 
            got caught after being tempted by some Yorkshire pudding that had been left out overnight 
            for the birds.</p>

        <p>After being caught, the monkey was returned to the park and 
            checked over by experts and will now be gradually reintroduced 
            to his group. <q>Honshu 
            has been carefully monitored by our vets and keepers and is doing really well.</q> - David Field added.</p>
